# Math Notes


### Combinations and Permutations:-
Mathematically, the different terms usually mean
1. Permutations: Number of ways in which n different things can be arranged among themselves (n!)
2. Combinations: Number of ways in which r things can be chosen from n different things (C(n,r))
3. Combination with order: Number of ways in which r things can be chosen from n different things, order of choosing being important (P(n,r))


### Binomial Distribution:-
Binomial distribution
Random number distribution that produces integers according to a binomial discrete distribution, which is described by the following probability mass function:


[Insert PMF here]
 

This distribution produces random integers in the range [0,t], where each value represents the number of successes in a sequence of t trials (each with a probability of success equal to p).
