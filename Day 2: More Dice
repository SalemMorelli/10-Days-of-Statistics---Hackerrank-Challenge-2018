Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. We recommend you review the previous challenge's Tutorial before attempting this problem. 


Task 
In a single toss of  fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of .


Answer
1/9

Explanation
The possibilities where the values of each die are different and their sum adds up to 6 is the following:-
(2,4) (4,2) (5,1) (1,5) = 4 possibilities
Therefore, (1/6 * 1/6) * 4 = 1/9
