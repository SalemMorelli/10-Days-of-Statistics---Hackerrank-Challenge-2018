Task 
You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

Answer 
12/51

Explanation
The question has not asked us the probability of picking a specific card twice and there for the probability of picking the first card
is not important to us. Therefore, once the first card has been picked there will be 51 cards left and 12 instead of 13 cards left if 
a card of the same suit were to be picked again. Therefore the probability is 12/51.
